# File Structure

As you can see in the Explorer of the VSCode, the project is basically structured like this:

```
.
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── archive/
├── contents/
├── data/
├── docs/
├── gatsby-browser.tsx
├── gatsby-config.mjs
├── gatsby-node.ts
├── lib/
├── node_modules/
├── package.json
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── postcss.config.mjs
├── public/
├── server/
├── src/
├── test/
└── tsconfig.json
```

The `contents/` folder contains all the MDX files that will be rendered into pages. 
Thus if you want to create a new page, you should create a new MDX file in the `contents/` folder.

# Page Creation

Take a closer look at the `contents/` folder, you will see that there are already some MDX files in it.

```
contents/
├── 0-project
│   ├── 0-description.mdx
│   ├── 1-design.mdx
│   ├── 2-contribution.mdx
│   ├── 3-P.O.C..mdx
│   └── 4-implementation.mdx
├── 1-wet-lab
│   ├── 0-engineering.mdx
│   ├── 1-results.mdx
│   ├── 2-parts.mdx
│   ├── 3-protocol.mdx
│   └── 4-notebook.mdx
├── 2-dry-lab
│   ├── 0-model.mdx
│   └── 1-hardware.mdx
├── 3-human-practices.mdx
├── 4-education.mdx
├── 5-safety.mdx
└── 6-attributions.mdx
```

Noticed that the MDX files are named in a certain pattern? 
Indeed, the naming pattern is important, as it will determine the order of the pages in the navigation.
For example, the `3-human-practices.mdx` will be the 4th item in the navigation.

Also, you might have noticed that some of the MDX files are in subfolders.
This is because the subfolders will be rendered as a dropdown menu in the navigation.

In conclusion, the prefix number determines the order of the navigation items, and the folder structure determines the dropdown menu structure.

Also, the rendered name of the page in the navigation, will be converted following rules:
1. The number prefix will be removed.
2. The hyphens will be replaced by spaces.
3. The letters will be capitalized according to the hyphens.
4. If the letter in file name is capitalized, it will be kept capitalized.

Now, you can try to create a new MDX file in the `contents/0-project/` folder called `5-test-page.mdx`, and writing:
  
````mdx
---
title: "Test Page"
slug: "test-page"
---

# This is a test page

Test test test.

````

Then you can run the project by:

```shell
pnpm run develop
```

Finally, open your browser to `http://localhost:8000/test-page` to see the new page, and it should be the last item in the navigation's dropdown menu of the `Project` item.

**Note Remember, if any new MDX file is created, you should restart the project to see the changes.**

# Frontmatter

## Overview

Frontmatter is pretty much just a configuration block for the page, at the beginning of your MDX file.

Like this:

```yaml
---
title: "Title"
favicon: "path/to/favicon"
slug: "path/to/page"
---
```

Currently, the following frontmatter fields are supported:

- `title`: The big title on the top of the page.

- `slug`: The URL path of the page.

- `favicon` (optional) : The favicon of the page, which will be shown in the browser tab.

- `tracer` (optional) : The cursor tracer of the page, which will following user's cursor.

## An Example of Frontmatter

The frontmatter of the current page is:

```yaml
---
title: "Page Creation"
slug: "docs/page-creation"
---
```

**Note: Remember to restart the project after changing the `slug` filed of any MDX file.**
