# Introduction

Before you actually editing anything on the real wiki, there are many pre-setup need to be done, for the sake of "seeing what you are writing".

## Software Tools

Our main software tool will be:

- Visual Studio Code

  - With Extensions:
    - `MDX` (Customized by ShanghaiTech's iGEM Team)
    - `Code Spell Checker`
    - `Prettier - Code formatter`

- iGEM CDN Tool

## OS Support

WSL > Linux > MacOS > Windows

So for users of windows, [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is highly recommended, **and all the commands should run in WSL**.
If you can't install or use WSL, please contact Linzheng Tang for direct support, **and do not follow other tutorials online**, especially when you actually know nothing about this.


Although MacOS are not tested at all, MacOS user could still follow the tutorial, please contact Linzheng Tang for any issue.

# Step 1: GitLab

For setting up GitLab and `git` so you could download the project and upload your edits.

## Install Git

You can first check if `git` installed by:

```shell
git -v
```

if it says `Command 'git' not found...`, you could install it by this command:

- For WSL / Linux
```shell
sudo apt install git
```
- For MacOS
```shell
brew install git
```

and remember to set up your name and email for `git` by:

```shell
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

```shell
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

## Generate SSH Key

Run this command in terminal:

```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 1024
```

Then you should see:

```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/name/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

Just continually hit `Enterâ†µ` until you see this like stuff:

```
+---[RSA 1024]----+
|.oooo=**.        |
|o+.+o.B .o       |
|oo+ +* o  =      |
|+o*..E.  + o     |
|.*.=+   S o      |
|+ =. o           |
|o+..  o          |
|.... .           |
|  .              |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Then run this command:

```shell
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

You'll then see your "public key", multiple lines of seemingly random text like this:

```
ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nzaahsdjkflkasjhdfkljdashlkfjhasdkljf
...
...
```

Copy these output text to your clipboard.

## Add your key to your GitLab account

Go to [iGEM's GitLab](https://gitlab.igem.org/2024/shanghaitech-china/) and login by your iGEM account.

![Login the GitLab](server/docs/gitlab-login.png)

After logging in, go to [this page](https://gitlab.igem.org/-/user_settings/ssh_keys).

![SSH Key Page](server/docs/gitlab-ssh-page.png)

Click the `Add new key` to add the key we just generate, just paste in and confirm your operation by `Add key`.

![Add New Key](server/docs/gitlab-ssh-confirm.png)

## Test if it works

Finally, test the configuration by run this in your terminal:

```shell
ssh -T git@gitlab.igem.org
```

it should outputs and you are set:

```
Welcome to GitLab, @yourname!
```

If you see this and your could open https://gitlab.igem.org/ in the browser:

```
Connection closed by 198.18.0.20 port 22
```

This is because the port 22 is blocked. three solutions are found:

- Don't use network provided by ShanghaiTech
- Use a proxy with clash's tun mode on.
- **Contact Linzheng Tang.**

## Clone the project

Finally, clone the project by:

```shell
git clone git@gitlab.igem.org:2024/shanghaitech-china.git
```

Then you should see a folder named `shanghaitech-china` appears, which contains the code.

_Feel free to rename that folder._


# Step 2: Node.js

In the terminal, run:

```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash
```

after `nvm` installed, restart your terminal, then run:

```shell
nvm install --lts
```

Finally, check if the node.js installed by:

```shell
node -v
```

It should output `v20.17.0`.

# Step 3: Deps

## Install dependencies
In the terminal, run:

```shell
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

You may notice some terrifying output, but don't worry, just input `y` and hit `Enterâ†µ` or type in your password to continue.

Then run this command:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

After that, run:

```shell
pnpm install -r
```

the core dependencies to run the project are all set.

## Test Run

To run the project, just run:

```shell
npm run develop
```

If you see this:
```
Deprecation Warning: The legacy JS API is deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 2.0.0.
```

Take it ease, it tells us something will be messed up in the future, but that's futureðŸ˜‡. 

After you see this:

```
You can now view shanghaitech-igem-wiki in the browser.

  http://localhost:8000/

View GraphQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and schema

  http://localhost:8000/___graphql
```

you can open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/` to see the wiki.


# Step 4: VSCode

## Install VSCode

Download the installer from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

### For WSL
If you are using WSL, before going on, you should install VSCode in Windows first, **then install the `WSL` extension**.

And finally run `code` in the WSL terminal to install VSCode Server inside WSL.

## Install Extensions

Run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
curl -o- https://gitlab.igem.org/zivmax/vscode-ext/-/raw/main/install-ext.sh | bash
```

## Open the project
Run this in the terminal:

```shell
code <project-folder-name>
```

Then VSCode should pop up and you could see the project in the sidebar.

# Step 5: CDN Tool
## Create Config File
Run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zivmax/igem-cdn/refs/heads/main/config-remote.sh | bash
```

Then VSCode should pop up for you to fill a template:
```
{
    "username": {
        "data": "your_username"
    },
    "password": {
        "data": "your_password"
    },
    "local_root": {
        "data": "/path/to/your/local/server"
    }
}
```

- Username: Your iGEM account username
- Password: Your iGEM account password
- Local Root: 
  1. First, Create a folder named `server` in the root of the project.
    ![Create Server Folder](server/docs/vscode-folder-create.png)
  1. Then, right-click the folder and select `Copy Path`.
    ![Copy Path](server/docs/vscode-copy-path.png)
  1. Use the path you just copied as the value of `local_root` in `data` field.

Save the file by `Ctrl+S`or `Cmd+S`.

## Install CDN Tool

First, ensure you can `unzip` things:
```shell
sudo apt install zip
```

Run the following command in the terminal:

- For X86:
```shell
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zivmax/igem-cdn/refs/heads/main/setup-remote.sh)" -- install X86
```

- For ARM (Apple Silicon):
```shell
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zivmax/igem-cdn/refs/heads/main/setup-remote.sh)" -- install ARM
```

Restart the terminal after the installation, if you are using VSCode integrated terminal, restart VSCode.

## Test CDN Tool

Run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
igem-cdn
```

And you should see the help message of the tool.
```
usage: igem-cdn [-h] [-rp REMOTE_PATH] [--config CONFIG]
                {delete,sync,download,upload,query} local_path
igem-cdn: error: the following arguments are required: action, local_path
```
