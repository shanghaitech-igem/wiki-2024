# Introduction

Before you actually editing anything on the real wiki, there are many pre-setup need to be done, for the sake of "seeing what you are writing".

## Software Tools
Our main software tool will be:

- Visual Studio Code
  - With Extensions:
    - `MDX` (Customized by ShanghaiTech's iGEM Team)
    - `Code Spell Checker`
    - `Prettier - Code formatter`        

- iGEM CDN Tool

## OS Support

WSL > Linux > MacOS > Windows 

So for users of windows, [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is highly recommended.
**If you can't install or use WSL, please contact Linzheng Tang for direct Windows Support.**

Although MacOS are not tested at all, MacOS user could still follow the tutorial, please contact Linzheng Tang for any issue. 

# Step 1: GitLab

For setting up GitLab and `git` so you could download the project and upload your edits.

## Install Git

You can first check if `git` installed by:
```shell
git -v
```

if it says `Command 'git' not found...`, you could install it by this command:
```shell
sudo apt install git
```

and remember to set up your name and email for `git` by:
```shell
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```
```shell
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

## Generate SSH Key 

Run this command in terminal:
```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 1024
```

Then you should see:
```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/name/.ssh/id_rsa): 
```

Just continually hit `Enterâ†µ` until you see this like stuff:
```
+---[RSA 1024]----+
|.oooo=**.        |
|o+.+o.B .o       |
|oo+ +* o  =      |
|+o*..E.  + o     |
|.*.=+   S o      |
|+ =. o           |
|o+..  o          |
|.... .           |
|  .              |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

Then run this command:
```shell
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

You'll then see your "public key", multiple lines of seemingly random text like this:
```
ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nzaahsdjkflkasjhdfkljdashlkfjhasdkljf
...
...
```

Copy these output text to your clipboard.

## Add your key to your GitLab account
Go to [iGEM's GitLab](https://gitlab.igem.org/2024/shanghaitech-china/) and login by your iGEM account.

After logging in, go to [this page](https://gitlab.igem.org/-/user_settings/ssh_keys).

![SSH Key Page](server/docs/gitlab-ssh-page.png)

Click the `Add new key` to add the key we just generate, just paste in and confirm your operation by `Add key`.

## Test if it works

Finally, test the configuration by run this in your terminal:
```shell
ssh -T git@gitlab.igem.org
```

it should outputs and you are set:
```
Welcome to GitLab, @yourname!
```


If you see this and your could open https://gitlab.igem.org/ in the browser:
```
Connection closed by 198.18.0.20 port 22
```

This is because the port 22 is blocked. three solutions are found:
- Don't use network provided by ShanghaiTech
- Use a proxy with clash's tun mode on.
- **Contact Linzheng Tang.**


# Step 2: Node.js

In the terminal, run:
```shell
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash
```

then run:
```shell
nvm install --lts
```

Finally, check if the node.js installed by:
```shell
node -v
```
It should output `v20.17.0`.
