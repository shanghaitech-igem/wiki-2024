She mentioned that small molecule drugs can be applied to ointments. In the special cosmetics sector, although only specific claims such as whitening, sun protection, and hair loss prevention are allowed, these products can claim to have certain skin repair functions and can be used as soothing cosmetics. Additionally, small molecules can be used in oral antibacterial products, which are currently very popular.\n\n\nIn the pharmaceutical sector, the development and application of antibacterial agents present significant challenges because all ingredients must be registered in the list of pharmaceutical raw materials. Otherwise, new raw materials need to be re-registered. Although the pharmaceutical market is large and cost advantages are evident, strict compliance with regulatory procedures is required.\n\n\nRegarding product testing, the first step is to confirm the name of the product (e.g., xx extract) and check the cosmetic ingredient directory. If the product is listed in the directory, its intermediate properties and microbial safety should be verified before use. If it is not listed, the active components need to be identified (through NMR and mass spectrometry analysis), and their efficacy (such as soothing effects, requiring human testing) and animal toxicology tests (using SPF-grade animals; qualified facilities are sufficient, not necessarily dependent on institutions) should be conducted. Additionally, acute skin irritation and sensitization tests should be performed, which can be done through third-party testing agencies, with final approval submitted to the national authority.\n\n\nFor the establishment of product standards, these can be set internally, as long as heavy metal content and other standards are not exceeded.

We introduced how our project aims to use synthetic biology methods to find pure natural substances to alleviate itching caused by Staphylococcus aureus, while avoiding severe consequences due to excessive scratching. We proposed various product forms, including rollerball applicators, bath gels, body lotions, and nail application, particularly focusing on developing 3D embossed nail designs that deliver medication through microfluidic channels.\n\n\nMs. Vivi believes that the rollerball applicator aligns better with the project's original intent. She mentioned that similar products already exist in the market and suggested conducting further market research to focus on the effectiveness and practicality of the drug itself, rather than placing too much emphasis on the appearance. She pointed out that nail application involves multiple uncertainties and potential risks, such as price, chemical reactions, allergic reactions, and environmental concerns. Long-term use of adhesives may also contradict the environmental goals of the project.\n\n\nMs. Vivi emphasized that the core of the product should be solving specific problems, and in balancing appearance and functionality, priority should be given to functionality and safety. She also suggested that we draw on the practicality of beauty and skincare products to enhance the market competitiveness of the rollerball applicator.
