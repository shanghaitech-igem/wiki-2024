# Find and verify problems
## Background:
In the current context of increasing health challenges, we feel the urgency and importance of developing an effective relief product for itching caused by Staphylococcus aureus (Staphylococcus aureus for short). 
Staphylococcus aureus, as a common pathogen, widely exists in the natural environment and human skin. 
Its infection not only causes skin inflammation, redness and swelling, but also **accompanies persistent and unbearable itching symptoms, which brings great trouble to the quality of life of patients**.


Through online research, we found several reasons and needs why we needed to develop a new itch relief product.

## The harm of Staphylococcus aureus causing itch
In the past 30 years, **the prevalence of AD has gradually increased worldwide**, and the prevalence of AD in children in developed countries has reached 10% to 20%. The increase of the prevalence of AD in China is later than that in western developed countries, Japan and South Korea, but it has increased rapidly in the past 10 years. According to the epidemiological survey conducted by Williams diagnostic criteria in China in 1998, the total prevalence rate of AD among school-age adolescents (6-20 years old) was 0.70%, and that among preschool children (1-7 years old) in 10 cities in 2002 was 2.78%. In 2012, the prevalence rate of children aged 3-6 in Shanghai was 8.3%. In 2014, using the diagnostic criteria of clinicians, the prevalence rate of AD in children aged 1-7 years in 12 cities in China reached 12.94%, and the prevalence rate of AD in infants aged 1-12 months was 30.48%.[^1]

Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacteria present in 20-30% of healthy subjects. The prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus in AD skin can reach 30-100%. Staphylococcus aureus and Atopic Dermatitis:  Mechanisms and Management and Colonization with Staphylococcus aureus in Atopic Dermatitis: A Review of the Literature mentions the presence of Staphylococcus aureus on the skin of about 70-90% of patients with atopic dermatitis.[^2]

Epub 2017 Sep 23. PMID: 28951239; PMCID: PMC5780352.

## Insufficient functions of existing products
Although there are many kinds of itching relief products on the market, most of them tend to focus on broad spectrum itching relief, and their **pertinence and effectiveness** are still insufficient for itching caused by specific pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus.


For existing hot products, **drug resistance** is the most important problem. Some products may contain hormonal components, long-term use may bring side effects, such as skin thinning, pigmentation, etc. Or a combination of drugs that is less effective and requires more hassle.

## The need for medicine
<Collapse title="Market demand growth">
  # Market demand growth

  Increased drug resistance: The wider use of antibiotics has led to increased drug resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, especially the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which has greatly reduced the effectiveness of traditional antibiotics. Therefore, the market is in urgent need of new antibiotic drug resistance.
- High infection rate: Staphylococcus aureus is the second most common type of pathogenic bacterial infection in hospitals, with a risk of infiltration into the community environment.
- Increased public health awareness: as one of the subareas of pruritus, and as public health awareness increases, Staphylococcus aureus infection is one of the common infectious diseases, and treatment drugs are also increasing.

</Collapse>

<Collapse title="The segment demand for medicine">
  # The segment demand for medicine

  - The need for different types of infection: Depending on the type and severity of infection, the need for antibiotic drugs varies. For example, patients with local infections may prefer topical antibiotic ointments, while patients with systemic infections may require systemic antibiotics administered orally or intravenously.
  - Needs of specific groups: Specific groups such as children, the elderly, immunocompromised people have more special needs for antibiotic drugs. These groups of people have higher requirements for the safety, effectiveness and side effects of drugs, so the market for these groups of exclusive antibiotic drugs also have great potential.

</Collapse>

<Collapse title="Technological innovation and Product development">
  # Technological innovation and Product development

  - Research and development of new antibiotics: Faced with the problem of resistance, scientific research institutions and pharmaceutical companies continue to invest resources in the research and development of new antibiotics. These new antibiotics have stronger antibacterial activity, lower resistance and better safety, which can meet the market demand for efficient and safe therapeutic drugs.
  - The promotion of precision medicine: With the development of precision medicine, precision treatment drugs for specific strains and infection types have become a research and development hotspot. This class of drugs can more accurately target Staphylococcus aureus and its resistance mechanisms, improve treatment effectiveness and reduce side effects, thus meeting the market demand for precision therapy.

<Collapse title="Policy environment supports">
  # Policy environment supports

  - Enhanced policy support and regulation: Governments are attaching greater importance to public health and drug safety, and a series of policies exist to support the development and production of related drugs. At the same time, the supervision of the drug market has been strengthened to ensure the quality and safety of drugs.
  - Medical insurance policy coverage: More countries will include drugs including antibiotics in the medical insurance list, reducing the economic burden of patients and improving the accessibility of drugs.

# Pursue the solution of the problem
## Interviews
To gain a better understanding of Staphylococcus aureus infections in daily life, we interviewed Dr. Wang Xue and Dr. Tang Zongxiang, both of whom have extensive knowledge about the spread of Staphylococcus aureus. We learned that this bacterium is very common in humans. When Staphylococcus aureus causes itching, especially if it persists over a long period, people tend to scratch involuntarily, leading to skin damage and potentially more severe infections. The most common solution in daily life is the use of antibiotics, such as penicillin and cephalosporins, which aligns with our previous research findings.


The doctor also noted that **antibiotics are unnecessary if the skin is not broken**, and overuse of antibiotics can lead to antibiotic resistance. They informed us that there are currently no specific products on the market designed to address itching caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Dr. Tang pointed out that there are many factors that can cause itching, and suggested that we consider these other factors as well. He introduced us to a characteristic of traditional Chinese **medicine—multi-target and multi-pathway approaches**—where the combination of multiple herbs can enhance the effectiveness of the treatment. This could potentially become a direction for our future research.


From an evolutionary biological perspective, itching is a protective mechanism. However, pathological itching is persistent and can significantly affect normal life, making it necessary to address. **The choice of product form should consider the mechanism and severity of the condition**. Skincare products with lower concentrations of active ingredients are suitable for mild symptoms, while drugs with higher concentrations of active ingredients are appropriate for severe symptoms. Even though patients may not initially recognize the seriousness of their itching, they often seek medical help as symptoms worsen, making our product highly relevant. We can offer multiple solutions and forms to flexibly meet different needs, and integrate with existing products to enhance their practicality and market competitiveness.

In order to assist consumers at the onset of itching symptoms, we aim to integrate our product into daily necessities, to alleviate itching in everyday life and prevent more serious outcomes.

  Professor Yang advises developing an anti-itch product with traditional Chinese medicine principles by starting with plant small molecules. This strategy includes screening and analyzing potential drugs from traditional medicines and verifying their effects through animal testing, streamlining the drug discovery process.
."
/>
Professor Yang pointed out that we can start with **the existing plant-based small molecules**, combined with the existing research on the molecular mechanism that causes itch, and design an experimental scheme to test the effectiveness of this small molecule on inhibiting itch.


In conclusion, we should first explore the molecular mechanism of Staphylococcus aureus causing itching, and then try to develop a method to screen the effectiveness of small molecules from the molecular mechanism, and obtain small molecules that can effectively reduce itching.  

## Explore the molecular mechanism
According to research[^3], Staphylococcus aureus secretes the V8 protease, which can cut the tail peptide of the EGFP receptor on the surface of human skin. When the target peptide is cut, it stimulates the nervous system to produce electrical signals, which in turn produces an itch sensation.

S. aureus drives itch and scratch-induced skin damage through a V8 protease-PAR1 axis. Cell. 2023 Nov 22;186(24):5375-5393.e25. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2023.10.019. PMID: 37995657; PMCID: PMC10669764.
## Design screening system
At the beginning of the experiment, we purified V8 protease in vitro, and tested its enzyme digestion activity with fluorescent substrates, so as to find substances that can inhibit the activity of V8 protease and inhibit itch sensation.

## Optimize screening system
In our communication with Professor Shen Pi, Professor Shen believed that we could not only build an in vitro screening system, but we could also choose chassis to build an **in vivo screening system**. In vivo screening system has three advantages: it can realize the screening function, can be used as a monitoring system, and can have more optimization prospects.


With this suggestion in mind, we selected Escherichia coli as the chassis organism and constructed a model expressing V8 protease and its fluorescence reporting system. The fluorescence reporting system, called Flipcherry, consists of two parts: a B1-9 fragment containing sfcherry, and a B10-11 fragment containing the target cutting site of the V8 protease and connected by a linker. When the V8 protease in E. coli is expressed and activated, it cuts the target sequence in the fluorescence reporting system, causing the two parts to self-assemble into a complete, efficient fluorescent protein structure, which fluoresces red. The intensity of red fluorescence can be used to indicate the intensity of itch sensation.


By adding different foreign substances and observing the changes of red fluorescence, we can screen out those substances that can effectively reduce the intensity of red fluorescence, that is, compounds that can effectively relieve itching, as our products.

# Grinding Solution
## Overview
During the interview process, the critical perspectives raised by stakeholders on our project were of great help in improving it. We refined our solutions based on the feedback received and ensured efficient operations across departments by expanding our interview pool as much as possible.


In our project, **summarizing stakeholders' feedback and needs** is crucial, as different groups have diverse priorities and perspectives on issues. For instance, doctors focused on our approach to alleviating itching, sharing clinical treatment information that guided us in identifying target populations. Meanwhile, project managers offered product design suggestions and aided in refining our initial business plan. This underscores that **interviewing individuals from multiple industries helps us gain a broader and more comprehensive understanding of our project's impact on the world.**
## Find the Direction of Development
At the beginning of the project, we planned to establish a **low-cost screening platform** to discover effective substances that can alleviate itching caused by Staphylococcus aureus. By adding different foreign substances and observing the changes in red fluorescence, we can screen out those substances that can effectively reduce the intensity of red fluorescence, that is, compounds that can **effectively relieve itching.**


At the same time, we wanted to give the project a richer meaning and ensure that our approach to solving the problem was novel and interesting, so we interviewed Professor **Yang Jidong.**

/>
After listening to our introduction to the project, Professor Yang Jidong suggested that we should think in the direction of **Chinese herbal medicine** when screening natural extracts, which gave us the idea of combining the project with Chinese medical culture.
## Enrich Project Connotation
Considering that members of the team have limited knowledge of TCM (traditional Chinese medicine), and TCM culture has a long history and a complex knowledge system, we then interviewed Yang Fan, an expert in the field of TCM, hoping to further understand TCM and get suggestions on the combination of our project and TCM.

  Dr. Yang Fan points out that itching is a common clinical issue that often leads to skin damage and worsens chronic inflammation. She notes the lack of objective diagnostic tests for itching and sees our E.coli-based itch detection platform as a valuable practical tool for clinical use. Her advice is to expand our platform's itch detection capabilities, screen traditional Chinese medicine ingredients, and explore a combination of Western and Chinese medical approaches to treatment."
/>
Dr. Yang Fan expressed her affirmation of the necessity of our target problem and informed us that itching is a common clinical symptom, the root cause of **repeated scratching behavior**, an important factor leading to skin apparent damage, aggravating chronic inflammation and skin barrier destruction, which often affects the quality of life of patients. At present, the judgment of itching degree mainly depends on the description of patients. This inspired us to improve the project in the future, namely to **create a product that can inhibit the initial stage of itching and reduce the damage caused by itching in patients**. 


At the same time, she also suggested that we expand the range of types of itch that can be detected, so that the E. coli platform we built can be applied to the search for drugs for more kinds of itch diseases, and help more people.
## Perfect Business Plan
We interviewed **Dr. Feng Chunbo** and **Ms. Cao Jinqiu** in order to improve the commercial feasibility of our project, get suggestions on the application scenarios of the project, and learn more about the suggestions of skin care companies for our project. From the interviews, we realized that: when formulating the business plan, the **audience should be clear**, our products should have **unique advantages** compared with competitive products, and at the same time, we should consider the use of traditional Chinese medicinal materials, so as to help the local government upgrade its industrial direction and produce a lot of economic effects. These suggestions have greatly helped us refine our business plan and provide a path for us to find ways to improve in the future.

In terms of promotion, he cautions against absolute statements or value judgments, recommending that we describe observed phenomena objectively based on scientific evidence.
"
 />
From this interview, we got a constructive suggestion to help promote the idea of the project: teaching the public that **blind sterilization is not always reasonable**, which may lead to the overuse of antibiotics and other problems. This helped to refine the design logic of the project, as Staphylococcus aureus is widely present in our environment and we cannot completely eliminate them. 


We believe that **bacteria are also part of the human ecosystem**, and by reducing their negative impact on our health, we can prevent more serious diseases from occurring. Therefore, our products are designed to **control the flora rather than kill it**. This also provided inspiration for our work in education. In community outreach, we popularized the methods of preventing Staphylococcus aureus infection to the public, so as to achieve the purpose of educating the public.

# How to Better Implement
## 1. Avoiding Long-Term Dependence on Antibiotics and Resistance Issues
### Problem Background
Frequent use of antibiotics leads to resistance, which has become a significant challenge in the medical and public health domains.
### Solution
**Non-Antibiotic Approach to Itch Relief:** 


We propose addressing itch issues without antibiotics, specifically by using natural small molecules. This method effectively avoids the problem of resistance, garners broad public acceptance, and increases product adoption.
**Technological Advantage:** 

Using biotechnology to extract and optimize natural plant small molecules to ensure their efficacy and safety, making them a reliable alternative to antibiotics.

## 2. Raising Public Awareness about Staphylococcus aureus-Related Issues
### Survey Data
- Nearly 90% of respondents are unaware of the cause of their itch.
- 66.7% endure the itch, waiting for it to naturally subside, 39.13% use over-the-counter itch relief, and 37.68% seek medical help.
- 66% consider it essential or significant to understand the dangers of Staphylococcus aureus.
- Nearly 80% believe there is a high or moderate necessity for skincare products addressing Staphylococcus aureus infection.
### Survey Results Analysis
While most people are unaware that Staphylococcus aureus causes itching, there is a desire to understand this issue and its importance in daily skincare. Therefore, raising public awareness of the problems caused by Staphylococcus aureus and other itch-related issues is necessary, with reference to existing soothing skincare products.
### Solution
*Integration with Existing Skincare/Cosmetics:**


Incorporate our product into existing skincare and cosmetic lines as a soothing cosmetic. This integration can greatly reduce the cost of educating the public on its standalone basis, allowing consumers to use our product naturally in their daily skincare routines.
## 3.Ensuring Product Safety
### Problem Background
Product safety is a primary concern for any new technology application.

### Solution
**Third-Party Testing Institution Consultations:**


By engaging with professional third-party testing institutions, we can more accurately position our product and ensure its safety throughout usage.

  Contents:
 We discussed the direction of small molecule drugs and their applications in cosmetics with Ms. Hao Chunqing. She mentioned that small molecule drugs can be applied to ointments. In the special cosmetics sector, although only specific claims such as whitening, sun protection, and hair loss prevention are allowed, these products can claim to have certain skin repair functions and can be used as soothing cosmetics. Additionally, small molecules can be used in oral antibacterial products, which are currently very popular.


In the pharmaceutical sector, the development and application of antibacterial agents present significant challenges because all ingredients must be registered in the list of pharmaceutical raw materials. Otherwise, new raw materials need to be re-registered. Although the pharmaceutical market is large and cost advantages are evident, strict compliance with regulatory procedures is required.


Regarding product testing, the first step is to confirm the name of the product (e.g., xx extract) and check the cosmetic ingredient directory. If the product is listed in the directory, its intermediate properties and microbial safety should be verified before use. If it is not listed, the active components need to be identified (through NMR and mass spectrometry analysis), and their efficacy (such as soothing effects, requiring human testing) and animal toxicology tests (using SPF-grade animals; qualified facilities are sufficient, not necessarily dependent on institutions) should be conducted. Additionally, acute skin irritation and sensitization tests should be performed, which can be done through third-party testing agencies, with final approval submitted to the national authority.


For the establishment of product standards, these can be set internally, as long as heavy metal content and other standards are not exceeded. This work can be completed by the laboratory."

## 4. Integrating Medication Conveniently into Daily Life
### Problem Background
To facilitate the convenient use of medication in daily routines.
### Solution
**Integration with Existing Products:**


When consumers experience itchiness but cannot identify the cause, our product can be combined with existing skincare and cosmetic products. This allows it to be used in daily care routines, not only resolving itchiness but also providing a more convenient user experience.
**Hardware Innovation:**


**Medication-Infused Nail Wearables:** Initially, we considered combining medication with nail wearables to administer the drug. However, due to its limited practicality and target audience, this plan was ultimately abandoned.

 During the interview, Ms. Vivi delved into the background, objectives, product principles, design, and future plans of our new project with us. We introduced how our project aims to use synthetic biology methods to find pure natural substances to alleviate itching caused by Staphylococcus aureus, while avoiding severe consequences due to excessive scratching. We proposed various product forms, including rollerball applicators, bath gels, body lotions, and nail application, particularly focusing on developing 3D embossed nail designs that deliver medication through microfluidic channels.


Ms. Vivi believes that the rollerball applicator aligns better with the project's original intent. She mentioned that similar products already exist in the market and suggested conducting further market research to focus on the effectiveness and practicality of the drug itself, rather than placing too much emphasis on the appearance. She pointed out that nail application involves multiple uncertainties and potential risks, such as price, chemical reactions, allergic reactions, and environmental concerns. Long-term use of adhesives may also contradict the environmental goals of the project.


Ms. Vivi emphasized that the core of the product should be solving specific problems, and in balancing appearance and functionality, priority should be given to functionality and safety. She also suggested that we draw on the practicality of beauty and skincare products to enhance the market competitiveness of the rollerball applicator. Ultimately, Ms. Vivi summarized that the synthetic biology project should focus on the actual effectiveness of the drug, ensuring practicality and safety, while innovating in the design of delivery systems."

### Head Scratcher with Roll-On Medication
The idea is to inject the medication into the head of the scratcher and deliver it through a roll-on mechanism. However, controlling the dosage was challenging, leading to modifications of this approach.

### Combination of Manual and Electric Scratcher
- **Manual Scratcher:** Allows for precise medication delivery, with the user freely controlling the dosage.
- **Electric Scratcher:** Integrates massage functionality, offering both a principled and physical method for itch relief. This ensures comfort and effective itch relief without damaging the skin.

## Summary:
Through the above solutions, our project not only offers a convenient, non-antibiotic alternative using advanced technology but also raises public awareness about Staphylococcus aureus and itch-related issues by integrating with existing products. Additionally, the multi-layered safety checks and practical design ensure that the product is safe and easy to use.
<split/>
# Conclusion
Our Human Practice efforts have been instrumental in shaping a product that is not only scientifically sound but also resonates with the needs and preferences of our target stakeholders. Through active engagement with a diverse range of experts and the public, we have ensured that our project is well-positioned for successful implementation and societal impact.
