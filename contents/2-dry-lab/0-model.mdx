# Overview

Modeling is a pivotal tool for understanding complex biological systems. In iGEM projects, modeling serves not only as a means to predict or interpret experimental data but also as a bridge for designing experiments and comprehending biological processes. A well-crafted model can reveal the intrinsic laws of a biological system, predict its behavior under various conditions, and guide experimental design. In our project, we have deepened our understanding of the v8 protease mechanism and optimized our experimental design by constructing and analyzing models.
