# Overview

Modeling is a pivotal tool for _understanding complex biological systems_, it serves not only as a means to predict or interpret experimental data but also as a bridge for designing experiments and comprehending biological processes. In our project, we have deepened our understanding of the **v8 protease mechanism** and **optimized our experimental design** by constructing and analyzing models. Modeling also **enhances the discovery of effective therapeutic agents** and **accelerates our experimental approach**.


### **Model 1: Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)**

Our [first model](#ode) employs **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)** to _simulate the expression levels of the v8 protease and key components within the flip-GFP system_. This model is crucial for understanding the dynamics of protein expression and its impact on receptor cleavage. By using ODEs, we can predict the behavior of these proteins in E.coli , which aids in the design of our therapeutic interventions.

### **Model 2: Molecular Simulation**
For our [second model](#molecular-simulation), we utilized **Homology Modeling** and **Molecular Dynamics** techniques. Initially, we performed homology modeling to obtain the structure of β10-E5-β11-K5, and then used **AlphaFold 2** to predict the structure of β1-β9. This step was followed by protein preparation (using **Schrodinger**) and molecular dynamics simulation (using **GROMACS**), which provided insights into the protein's behavior at the atomic level. This model is instrumental in _understanding the flip-GFP system_.

### **Model 3: Relative Fluorescence Model**

The [third model](#relative-fluorescence-model), which is the **Relative Fluorescence Model**, was developed to quantify the relationship between relative fluorescence and time, for relative fluorescence intensity is a function of the concentration of flipCherrysf while the concentration of flipCherrysf is also a function of time. By implying this model, we are able to _predict the change of fluorescence intensity with time and examine if the self-packing ODE model is correct._

### **Model 4: Virtual Screening**

Our [final model](#virtual-screening) involves **Virtual Screening**, where we searched the ChemDiv library for small molecules that can inhibit the v8 protease. This in silico approach allows us to _narrow down potential candidates without the need for laborious and costly experimental trials._ The model's output guides our experimental design by predicting which compounds are most likely to be effective inhibitors.
