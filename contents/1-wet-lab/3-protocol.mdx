# Protein Purification

1. Centrifuge the bacterial liquid (1L centrifuge tube, double-layer lid, high-speed centrifuge, 4500rpm, 12 minutes, at 16 degrees).

2. While waiting for the centrifugation, prepare the lysis buffer: 50mM Tris HCl (pH=8), 300mM NaCl. Resuspend the centrifuged bacterial liquid in 40mL of lysis buffer. Then use a high-pressure homogenizer to break the bacterial liquid.

3. Transfer the broken bacterial liquid to a high-speed centrifuge tube and centrifuge (18500rpm, 4 degrees, 45 minutes). While waiting, prepare two types of elution buffers (20mM imidazole, 350mM imidazole); take 7 1.5mL EP tubes, add 5μL of loading buffer to each for later running of the protein gel (before and after sedimentation); resuspend the nickel beads; add 2mL of nickel bead solution to the column, open the bottom outlet of the column, let the ethanol from the nickel bead solution flow out, and add lysis buffer for washing, trying not to drain it completely.

4. Take the supernatant from the centrifuged solution (bacterial debris + protein solution) and pour it into the nickel column, gently rotate to resuspend the beads, then transfer the solution to a 50mL centrifuge tube. Incubate in a cold room for 1 hour; take a 96-well plate, add 10 wells for each protein, and add 50μL of Bradford reagent, referred to as BF.

5. After incubation, pour the mixture into the column, open the bottom outlet, and take the fifth drop of the sample to add to BF and loading buffer.

6. Add 20mM imidazole elution buffer, adding 4mL each time, gently rotate to resuspend the beads, wait on ice for about 3 minutes, open the bottom outlet, take 10μL to add to BF, mix well, and compare the color changes, repeating multiple times until the color does not change after adding the dye. At the same time, take 20μL from the first wash and the last wash to add to the loading buffer for "before" and "after".

7. Add 350mM imidazole elution buffer, adding 1.5mL each time. Rotate the column to resuspend the beads and fully mix with the elution buffer. Wait on ice for about 3 minutes for the beads to resettle. Open the bottom outlet and connect a 1.5mL EP tube, similarly adding samples to BF and observing the color change; repeat the operation until the color changes to light blue after adding the dye. Pour the multi-tube protein samples into a concentration tube and take 20μL to add to the loading buffer for "elution".

8. Heat all the centrifuge tubes containing protein at 99°C for 5 minutes; briefly centrifuge; load into the protein gel (10μL sample + 10μL marker); run the gel (first at 120V for 15 minutes, then at 200V for 35 minutes).

9. Stain with Coomassie Brilliant Blue solution, then decolorize with Coomassie Brilliant Blue decolorizing solution and water.

10. Concentrate the solution. First, pre-cool the centrifuge to 4 degrees, centrifuge at 2500rpm for 3 minutes, and repeatedly centrifuge to concentrate the solution volume to below 1000μL.

11. Freeze the samples. Add 20% volume of glycerol to the protein solution, aliquot into small tubes, adding 100μL to each tube, and freeze in a -40°C freezer.

# Mass Spectrometry

## In-Gel Digestion of Proteins from SDS-PAGE Gel

Reagents:

1. 25 mM $\ce{NH_4HCO_3}$ (pH 7.8)
2. 25 mM $\ce{NH_4HCO_3}$/Acetonitrile (ACN) (1:1) (Destaining Solution)
3. Pure Acetonitrile (ACN)
4. 20 μL per tube of 1M DTT (prepared in advance) and 20 μL per tube of 1M IAM (prepared in advance)
5. 50% ACN/0.5% FA (only for use on the second day)

Notes:

1. Ensure thorough mixing (vortex) after adding each solution to fully immerse the gel pieces. Adjust the volume of solutions based on the size of the gel pieces. Remove the solution before proceeding to the next step.
2. Ensure cleanliness of reagents and equipment throughout the process to avoid keratin contamination.

Procedure:

1. Cut the selected gel bands into approximately 1.5 mm pieces using a gel excision pen or scalpel. Place the pieces into labeled eppendorf (EP) tubes.
2. Add an appropriate amount of purified water (e.g., Wahaha purified water) to wash the gel pieces twice, ensuring all pieces are fully immersed. Remove the water after washing.
3. Add 25 mM $\ce{NH_4HCO_3}$/ACN (1:1) (twice the volume of the gel pieces) to the tube. Shake in a thermomixer at 37°C for 10 minutes (500 rpm) to destain. Remove the solution. Repeat until the blue color dissipates (note: destaining is not required if the gel is silver-stained).
4. Dehydrate the gel pieces by adding pure ACN, shaking for 10 minutes (500 rpm). Repeat once, ensuring the gel pieces turn white. Remove the ACN and vacuum dry for 10 minutes until completely dry.
5. Add 10 mM DTT (prepared by diluting 10 μL of 1M DTT with 990 μL of 25 mM $\ce{NH_4HCO_3}$) to the gel pieces, and incubate in a thermomixer at 56°C and 500 rpm for 1 hour.
6. Cool to room temperature, remove the solution, and quickly add 25 mM IAM (prepared by diluting 20 μL of 1M IAM with 780 μL of 25 mM $\ce{NH_4HCO_3}$). Incubate in the dark (e.g., in a drawer) for 45 minutes.
7. Sequentially wash the gel pieces with 25 mM $\ce{NH_4HCO_3}$ (2x10 minutes), 25 mM $\ce{NH_4HCO_3}$/ACN (1:1) (2x10 minutes), and ACN for 10 minutes (dehydrate until the gel pieces turn white). Vacuum dry for 10 minutes until completely dry.
8. Based on the amount of gel pieces and the protein content (protein-to-enzyme mass ratio of 50:1), dilute 0.5 μg/μL enzyme with 25 mM $\ce{NH_4HCO_3}$ and add to the gel pieces to fully absorb the enzyme solution. Incubate at 37°C, 500 rpm, for 10 minutes.
9. Remove the EP tubes. Transfer all the supernatant from each tube to new EP tubes and acidify with 50% FA until the pH is below 5.
10. Add 200 μL of 50%ACN/0.5%FA to the gel pieces (adjust the volume according to the size of the gel pieces). Vortex mix in a thermomixer at 500 rpm for 10 minutes, then centrifuge at 3000g for 3 minutes. Transfer all supernatants from each tube to the corresponding new EP tubes from step 9. Repeat this step once.
11. Place the new EP tubes in a SpeedVac to dry. Redissolve the samples in 100 μL of 0.1% FA, vortex mix, and centrifuge at high speed (12000g) for 5 minutes in preparation for desalting.

## Desalting (Stage-tip Method)

Buffer A: 0.1% FA; Buffer B: 70% ACN, 0.1% FA

1. Place the stage-tip in a 1.5 mL EP tube without a cap, using a white frit. Add 200 μL of Buffer B to the tip, centrifuge at 500g for 3 minutes, and discard the flow-through. Repeat once.
2. Add 200 μL of Buffer A to the tip, centrifuge at 500g for 3 minutes, and discard the flow-through. Repeat once.
3. Load the protein digest supernatant (from step 11 above) onto the tip, centrifuge at 500g for 3 minutes. Collect the flow-through and reload it onto the tip once.
4. Wash the tip with 100 μL of Buffer A, centrifuge at 500g for 3 minutes. Discard the flow-through.
5. Elute the peptides with 200 μL of Buffer B into a new EP tube, centrifuge at 500g for 3 minutes.
6. Dry the EP tube in a SpeedVac (keep the white frit).
7. Submit the samples to the appropriate personnel for further analysis.
