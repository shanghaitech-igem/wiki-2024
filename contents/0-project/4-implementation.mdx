# Background

Amidst the growing health challenges, we have addressed the itching caused by Staphylococcus aureus by identifying substances that alleviate this condition through our E.coli platform and fluorescence reporting system. The application of these substances in everyday products, such as skincare items, represents an innovative approach.


This integration not only significantly reduces the educational outreach costs associated with standalone products but also seamlessly integrates our product into consumers' daily skincare practices. Moreover, with this positioning, our product does not require the rigorous testing and clinical trials that drugs do, allowing for a swift market launch, provided it is both effective and safe.

# Challenges
- Due to the highly individualized nature of the sensation of itching, it may be challenging to comprehensively verify the product's effectiveness during the testing phase.
- Given the limited public awareness of Staphylococcus aureus, additional resources may need to be allocated to educate consumers and enhance their understanding and recognition of the product's value.
- Establishing a solid cooperative relationship with B-end businesses may pose certain difficulties. 
- The virtual screening results may not be optimal.
- In wet lab experiments, we encountered two primary challenges. Firstly, the purification of V8 protease, which is essential for in vitro validation experiments, is complicated by its tendency to undergo self-degradation. We can only prevent this by adding a propeptide, which, however, inhibits the enzyme's activity. Thus, successfully obtaining V8 protease presents a significant challenge. Secondly, the challenge arises from the E. coli in vivo system, which, due to the need to express multiple protein segments, imposes a certain metabolic burden on the bacteria. If the induction time is shortened to reduce the expression level, the protein concentration might become too low for effective self-assembly to occur.
