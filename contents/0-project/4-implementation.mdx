# Background

Amidst the growing health challenges, we have addressed the itching caused by Staphylococcus aureus by identifying substances that alleviate this condition through our E.coli platform and fluorescence reporting system. The application of these substances in everyday products, such as skincare items, represents an innovative approach.


This integration not only significantly reduces the educational outreach costs associated with standalone products but also seamlessly integrates our product into consumers' daily skincare practices. Moreover, with this positioning, our product does not require the rigorous testing and clinical trials that drugs do, allowing for a swift market launch, provided it is both effective and safe.

# Competitive Analysis

| Product | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| :------: | :------: | :------: |
| Traditional Anti-itch Medications | Widely used, high brand recognition, and easily accessible | Often rely on inhibiting nerve receptors, which may have side effects; short-lived effects and can lead to drug resistance. For example, some topical medications containing steroids can quickly alleviate symptoms but may cause skin thinning and other health issues with long-term use |
| Antibiotic Products | Effective against bacterial infections and can rapidly control symptoms | Prone to induce drug resistance, and the antibiotic resistance to Staphylococcus aureus is becoming increasingly serious. Additionally, simple antibiotic treatments do not effectively alleviate itching sensations |
| Plant Extracts and Natural Ingredients | Relatively safe, highly accepted in the market, and can reduce skin irritation | Often lack strong efficacy and lack clear molecular mechanisms to support their claims. Many products rely solely on the soothing effects of plant components without targeting specific causes |
| Biologic Formulations | Significantly effective for specific diseases, especially advantageous in the management of chronic conditions | Expensive, high barriers to use, and typically require prescriptions from medical institutions, making them unsuitable for large-scale daily use |
