This project leverages the sensory mechanisms of itch perception to engineer a specific sequence expression in *Escherichia coli* (E. coli). 
By integrating red fluorescent protein as a reporter, we can monitor the levels of itchiness. 
Our ultimate goal is to use these genetically modified *E. coli* to identify and isolate natural compounds that can effectively inhibit itch without causing harm.

The transformative potential of this project lies in its application to the fashion and cosmetics industry. 
By developing new, safe, and effective anti-itch treatments derived from natural sources, we can create innovative skincare products that address itchinessâ€”a common concern for many consumers. 
This aligns perfectly with the industry's move towards sustainability and cruelty-free solutions.
