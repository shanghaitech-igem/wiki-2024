# Find and verify problems
## Background:
In the current context of increasing health challenges, we feel the urgency and importance of developing an effective relief product for itching caused by Staphylococcus aureus (Staphylococcus aureus for short). Staphylococcus aureus, as a common pathogen, widely exists in the natural environment and human skin. Its infection not only causes skin inflammation, redness and swelling, but also accompanies persistent and unbearable itching symptoms, which brings great trouble to the quality of life of patients.
Through online research, we found several reasons why we needed to develop a new itch relief product.

## The harm of Staphylococcus aureus causing itch
In the past 30 years, the prevalence of AD has gradually increased worldwide, and the prevalence of AD in children in developed countries has reached 10% to 20%. The increase of the prevalence of AD in China is later than that in western developed countries, Japan and South Korea, but it has increased rapidly in the past 10 years. According to the epidemiological survey conducted by Williams diagnostic criteria in China in 1998, the total prevalence rate of AD among school-age adolescents (6-20 years old) was 0.70%, and that among preschool children (1-7 years old) in 10 cities in 2002 was 2.78%. In 2012, the prevalence rate of children aged 3-6 in Shanghai was 8.3%. In 2014, using the diagnostic criteria of clinicians, the prevalence rate of AD in children aged 1-7 years in 12 cities in China reached 12.94%, and the prevalence rate of AD in infants aged 1-12 months was 30.48%.
Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacteria present in 20-30% of healthy subjects. The prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus in AD skin can reach 30-100%. Staphylococcus aureus and Atopic Dermatitis:  Mechanisms and Management and Colonization with Staphylococcus aureus in Atopic Dermatitis: A Review of the Literature mentions the presence of Staphylococcus aureus on the skin of about 70-90% of patients with atopic dermatitis.

## Insufficient functions of existing products
Although there are many kinds of itching relief products on the market, most of them tend to focus on broad spectrum itching relief, and their pertinence and effectiveness are still insufficient for itching caused by specific pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus.
For existing hot products, drug resistance is the most important problem. Some products may contain hormonal components, long-term use may bring side effects, such as skin thinning, pigmentation, etc. Or a combination of drugs that is less effective and requires more hassle.

## The need for medicine
<Collapse title="Market demand growth">
  # Market demand growth

  Increased drug resistance: The wider use of antibiotics has led to increased drug resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, especially the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which has greatly reduced the effectiveness of traditional antibiotics. Therefore, the market is in urgent need of new antibiotic drug resistance.
- High infection rate: Staphylococcus aureus is the second most common type of pathogenic bacterial infection in hospitals, with a risk of infiltration into the community environment.
- Increased public health awareness: as one of the subareas of pruritus, and as public health awareness increases, Staphylococcus aureus infection is one of the common infectious diseases, and treatment drugs are also increasing.

  # The segment demand for medicine

  - The need for different types of infection: Depending on the type and severity of infection, the need for antibiotic drugs varies. For example, patients with local infections may prefer topical antibiotic ointments, while patients with systemic infections may require systemic antibiotics administered orally or intravenously.
  - Needs of specific groups: Specific groups such as children, the elderly, immunocompromised people have more special needs for antibiotic drugs. These groups of people have higher requirements for the safety, effectiveness and side effects of drugs, so the market for these groups of exclusive antibiotic drugs also have great potential.

# Pursue the solution of the problem
## Interviews
After conducting preliminary desk research, we have identified a significant issue that needs to be addressed - the problem of pruritus caused by Staphylococcus aureus. How can we effectively resolve this problem? Our team has reached out to multiple experts for conducting interviews.

  role="Member of the Dermatology Branch of the China Association of Chinese Medicine, Standing Committee Member of the Guizhou Medical Aesthetics and Beauty Association, Member of the Guizhou Medical Accident Appraisal Expert Database."
  brief="Following our discussion with Professor Yang, we've arrived at a promising concept: To effectively address itching while merging it with the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, we should consider exploring plant-based small molecules. By leveraging current research, compiling a selection of frequently utilized Chinese herbal remedies, and performing a network pharmacology analysis, we can then advance to animal testing to assess the efficacy of these treatments. This approach will facilitate the discovery of potent drugs or bioactive small molecules, thereby establishing a solid foundation for their use in clinical settings. Additionally, we could exploit your team's sophisticated drug screening system to directly identify potential therapeutic candidates."
/>
Professor Yang pointed out that we can start with the existing plant-based small molecules, combined with the existing research on the molecular mechanism that causes itch, and design an experimental scheme to test the effectiveness of this small molecule on inhibiting itch.
In conclusion, we should first explore the molecular mechanism of Staphylococcus aureus causing itching, and then try to develop a method to screen the effectiveness of small molecules from the molecular mechanism, and obtain small molecules that can effectively reduce itching.  

## Explore the molecular mechanism
According to research, Staphylococcus aureus secretes the V8 protease, which can cut the tail peptide of the EGFP receptor on the surface of human skin. When the target peptide is cut, it stimulates the nervous system to produce electrical signals, which in turn produces an itch sensation.

## Design screening system
At the beginning of the experiment, we purified V8 protease in vitro, and tested its enzyme digestion activity with fluorescent substrates, so as to find substances that can inhibit the activity of V8 protease and inhibit itch sensation.

## Optimize screening system
In our communication with Professor Shen Pi, Professor Shen believed that we could not only build an in vitro screening system, but we could also choose chassis to build an in vivo screening system. In vivo screening system has three advantages: it can realize the screening function, can be used as a monitoring system, and can have more optimization prospects.
With this suggestion in mind, we selected Escherichia coli as the chassis organism and constructed a model expressing V8 protease and its fluorescence reporting system. The fluorescence reporting system, called Flipcherry, consists of two parts: a B1-9 fragment containing sfcherry, and a B10-11 fragment containing the target cutting site of the V8 protease and connected by a linker. When the V8 protease in E. coli is expressed and activated, it cuts the target sequence in the fluorescence reporting system, causing the two parts to self-assemble into a complete, efficient fluorescent protein structure, which fluoresces red. The intensity of red fluorescence can be used to indicate the intensity of itch sensation.
By adding different foreign substances and observing the changes of red fluorescence, we can screen out those substances that can effectively reduce the intensity of red fluorescence, that is, compounds that can effectively relieve itching, as our products.

# Grinding Solution
## Overview
During the interview process, the critical perspectives raised by stakeholders on our project were of great help in improving it. We refined our solutions based on the feedback received and ensured efficient operations across departments by expanding our interview pool as much as possible.
In our project, **summarizing stakeholders' feedback and needs **is crucial, as different groups have diverse priorities and perspectives on issues. For instance, doctors focused on our approach to alleviating itching, sharing clinical treatment information that guided us in identifying target populations. Meanwhile, project managers offered product design suggestions and aided in refining our initial business plan. This underscores that **interviewing individuals from multiple industries helps us gain a broader and more comprehensive understanding of our project's impact on the world.**
## Find the Direction of Development
At the beginning of the project, we planned to establish a** low-cost screening platform **to discover effective substances that can alleviate itching caused by Staphylococcus aureus. By adding different foreign substances and observing the changes in red fluorescence, we can screen out those substances that can effectively reduce the intensity of red fluorescence, that is, compounds that can** effectively relieve itching.**
At the same time, we wanted to give the project a richer meaning and ensure that our approach to solving the problem was novel and interesting, so we interviewed Professor **Yang Jidong.**
{/* 缺名片 */}
After listening to our introduction to the project, Professor Yang Jidong suggested that we should think in the direction of **Chinese herbal medicine** when screening natural extracts, which gave us the idea of combining the project with Chinese medical culture.
## Enrich Project Connotation
Considering that members of the team have limited knowledge of TCM (traditional Chinese medicine), and TCM culture has a long history and a complex knowledge system, we then interviewed** Yang Fan**, an expert in the field of TCM, hoping to further understand TCM and get suggestions on the combination of our project and TCM.
{/* 缺名片 */}
Dr. Yang Fan expressed her affirmation of the necessity of our target problem and informed us that itching is a common clinical symptom, the root cause of repeated scratching behavior, an important factor leading to skin apparent damage, aggravating chronic inflammation and skin barrier destruction, which often affects the quality of life of patients. At present, the judgment of itching degree mainly depends on the description of patients. This inspired us to improve the project in the future, namely to **create a product that can inhibit the initial stage of itching and reduce the damage caused by itching in patients**. 
At the same time, she also suggested that we expand the range of types of itch that can be detected, so that the E. coli platform we built can be applied to the search for drugs for more kinds of itch diseases, and help more people.
## Perfect Business Plan
We interviewed **Dr. Feng Chunbo** and **Ms. Cao Jinqiu** in order to improve the commercial feasibility of our project, get suggestions on the application scenarios of the project, and learn more about the suggestions of skin care companies for our project. From the interviews, we realized that: when formulating the business plan, the **audience should be clear**, our products should have** unique advantages** compared with competitive products, and at the same time, we should consider the use of traditional Chinese medicinal materials, so as to help the local government upgrade its industrial direction and produce a lot of economic effects. These suggestions have greatly helped us refine our business plan and provide a path for us to find ways to improve in the future.

## Educate the Public Effectively
We interviewed the popular science blogger **Liu Pengxin**, it is worth mentioning that he is also a professor of chemistry in our school. Considering his professionalism and rich experience in popularizing skin care products to the public, we sought his advice on the publicity of this project.
{/* 缺名片 */}
From this interview, we got a constructive suggestion to help promote the idea of the project: teaching the public that **blind sterilization is not always reasonable**, which may lead to the overuse of antibiotics and other problems. This helped to refine the design logic of the project, as Staphylococcus aureus is widely present in our environment and we cannot completely eliminate them. 
We believe that **bacteria are also part of the human ecosystem**, and by reducing their negative impact on our health, we can prevent more serious diseases from occurring. Therefore, our products are designed to **control the flora rather than kill it**. This also provided inspiration for our work in education. In community outreach, we popularized the methods of preventing Staphylococcus aureus infection to the public, so as to achieve the purpose of educating the public.
# Stakeholders
Our team places a high priority on connecting with our stakeholders and interacts with them in a variety of ways, including emails, tours, and online and offline interviews. We record our interviews in a timely manner and quickly feed this information back to the entire team for improvement. This process shapes our interview forms and ensures that we are able to continuously optimize our communication and collaboration with our stakeholders.
{/* 可以插入一张记录表格 */}
Through exhaustive desk research and in-depth interviews, we gradually identified key stakeholders and built strong and deep relationships with them. In the process, we gained a deep understanding of their core concerns and values in their respective fields.

**Business**
- PACIFY products will be incorporated into other companies' products as value-added and cost-effective raw materials to enhance the value of customers' products. Our target customers include companies that develop and market products for anti-itching and daily care.
- To understand user feedback and assess the commercialization potential of the product, we conducted interviews with companies such as Shanghai [Jahwa](https://www.jahwa.com.cn/en), MOCHU, and [Everest Medicines](https://www.everestmedicines.com/about-us/company-overview/) to help determine the commercial value of the PACIFY product.

**customers**


In order to find out what the general public, i.e. customers, think about Staphylococcus aureus, itchiness and our products, we conducted a survey by means of a questionnaire.

**Doctor**
- Staphylococcus aureus, a very common conditional pathogen, is also a common pathogen in community and hospital infections.
- Physicians are frequently exposed to infected patients and are well aware of S. aureus infection routes, treatments, and their shortcomings.
- Further interviews with physicians were conducted to better understand the impact of S. aureus on the general public, transmission and routes of infection, as well as to assess the effectiveness and utility of our product. 

**Scientists**


During the course of the project, we encountered challenges on modeling, wetlab, and in order to ensure the professionalism and accuracy of the research, we interviewed professors at the school as well as scientists at the institute to seek help and advice from them.

**Testing Organization**


In order to ensure that our products comply with the relevant standards in terms of quality, safety and efficacy, and successfully pass the testing and certification procedures required for market access, we have also interviewed a number of testing organizations to clarify the scope of testing and requirements for our products.

**Industry Leaders**


We realize that in addition to understanding and communicating with the people involved, we also actively engage with leaders in the community to get more diverse feedback, such as well-known bloggers in the scientific community, experts in the field of industrial design, and so on.

**Informed consent form**


In order to ensure the security of the interviewer's personal information and the legitimacy of our information acquisition, our team developed an informed consent form. This consent form is intended to clarify the purpose of the interview, its content and how the data will be used, and to ensure that the interviewer is fully aware of the information and participates voluntarily.

We propose addressing itch issues without antibiotics, specifically by using natural small molecules. This method effectively avoids the problem of resistance, garners broad public acceptance, and increases product adoption.
**Technological Advantage:** 


Using biotechnology to extract and optimize natural plant small molecules to ensure their efficacy and safety, making them a reliable alternative to antibiotics.

## 2. Raising Public Awareness about Staphylococcus aureus-Related Issues
### Survey Data
- Nearly 90% of respondents are unaware of the cause of their itch.
- 66.7% endure the itch, waiting for it to naturally subside, 39.13% use over-the-counter itch relief, and 37.68% seek medical help.
- 66% consider it essential or significant to understand the dangers of Staphylococcus aureus.
- Nearly 80% believe there is a high or moderate necessity for skincare products addressing Staphylococcus aureus infection.
### Survey Results Analysis
While most people are unaware that Staphylococcus aureus causes itching, there is a desire to understand this issue and its importance in daily skincare. Therefore, raising public awareness of the problems caused by Staphylococcus aureus and other itch-related issues is necessary, with reference to existing soothing skincare products.
### Solution
*Integration with Existing Skincare/Cosmetics:**


Incorporate our product into existing skincare and cosmetic lines as a soothing cosmetic. This integration can greatly reduce the cost of educating the public on its standalone basis, allowing consumers to use our product naturally in their daily skincare routines.
