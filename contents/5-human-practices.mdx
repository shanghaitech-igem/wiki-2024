# Find and verify problems
## Background:
In the current context of increasing health challenges, we feel the urgency and importance of developing an effective relief product for itching caused by Staphylococcus aureus (Staphylococcus aureus for short). Staphylococcus aureus, as a common pathogen, widely exists in the natural environment and human skin. Its infection not only causes skin inflammation, redness and swelling, but also accompanies persistent and unbearable itching symptoms, which brings great trouble to the quality of life of patients.
Through online research, we found several reasons why we needed to develop a new itch relief product.

## The harm of Staphylococcus aureus causing itch
In the past 30 years, the prevalence of AD has gradually increased worldwide, and the prevalence of AD in children in developed countries has reached 10% to 20%. The increase of the prevalence of AD in China is later than that in western developed countries, Japan and South Korea, but it has increased rapidly in the past 10 years. According to the epidemiological survey conducted by Williams diagnostic criteria in China in 1998, the total prevalence rate of AD among school-age adolescents (6-20 years old) was 0.70%, and that among preschool children (1-7 years old) in 10 cities in 2002 was 2.78%. In 2012, the prevalence rate of children aged 3-6 in Shanghai was 8.3%. In 2014, using the diagnostic criteria of clinicians, the prevalence rate of AD in children aged 1-7 years in 12 cities in China reached 12.94%, and the prevalence rate of AD in infants aged 1-12 months was 30.48%.
Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacteria present in 20-30% of healthy subjects. The prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus in AD skin can reach 30-100%. Staphylococcus aureus and Atopic Dermatitis:  Mechanisms and Management and Colonization with Staphylococcus aureus in Atopic Dermatitis: A Review of the Literature mentions the presence of Staphylococcus aureus on the skin of about 70-90% of patients with atopic dermatitis.

## Insufficient functions of existing products
Although there are many kinds of itching relief products on the market, most of them tend to focus on broad spectrum itching relief, and their pertinence and effectiveness are still insufficient for itching caused by specific pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus.
For existing hot products, drug resistance is the most important problem. Some products may contain hormonal components, long-term use may bring side effects, such as skin thinning, pigmentation, etc. Or a combination of drugs that is less effective and requires more hassle.

## The need for medicine
<Collapse title="Market demand growth">
  # Market demand growth

  Increased drug resistance: The wider use of antibiotics has led to increased drug resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, especially the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which has greatly reduced the effectiveness of traditional antibiotics. Therefore, the market is in urgent need of new antibiotic drug resistance.
- High infection rate: Staphylococcus aureus is the second most common type of pathogenic bacterial infection in hospitals, with a risk of infiltration into the community environment.
- Increased public health awareness: as one of the subareas of pruritus, and as public health awareness increases, Staphylococcus aureus infection is one of the common infectious diseases, and treatment drugs are also increasing.

  # The segment demand for medicine

  - The need for different types of infection: Depending on the type and severity of infection, the need for antibiotic drugs varies. For example, patients with local infections may prefer topical antibiotic ointments, while patients with systemic infections may require systemic antibiotics administered orally or intravenously.
  - Needs of specific groups: Specific groups such as children, the elderly, immunocompromised people have more special needs for antibiotic drugs. These groups of people have higher requirements for the safety, effectiveness and side effects of drugs, so the market for these groups of exclusive antibiotic drugs also have great potential.

  # Technological innovation and Product development

  - Research and development of new antibiotics: Faced with the problem of resistance, scientific research institutions and pharmaceutical companies continue to invest resources in the research and development of new antibiotics. These new antibiotics have stronger antibacterial activity, lower resistance and better safety, which can meet the market demand for efficient and safe therapeutic drugs.
  - The promotion of precision medicine: With the development of precision medicine, precision treatment drugs for specific strains and infection types have become a research and development hotspot. This class of drugs can more accurately target Staphylococcus aureus and its resistance mechanisms, improve treatment effectiveness and reduce side effects, thus meeting the market demand for precision therapy.

  # Policy environment supports

  - Enhanced policy support and regulation: Governments are attaching greater importance to public health and drug safety, and a series of policies exist to support the development and production of related drugs. At the same time, the supervision of the drug market has been strengthened to ensure the quality and safety of drugs.
  - Medical insurance policy coverage: More countries will include drugs including antibiotics in the medical insurance list, reducing the economic burden of patients and improving the accessibility of drugs.

# Pursue the solution of the problem
## Interviews
After conducting preliminary desk research, we have identified a significant issue that needs to be addressed - the problem of pruritus caused by Staphylococcus aureus. How can we effectively resolve this problem? Our team has reached out to multiple experts for conducting interviews.


# Stakeholders

Our team places a high priority on connecting with our stakeholders and interacts with them in a variety of ways, including emails, tours, and online and offline interviews. We record our interviews in a timely manner and quickly feed this information back to the entire team for improvement. This process shapes our interview forms and ensures that we are able to continuously optimize our communication and collaboration with our stakeholders.
{/* 可以插入一张记录表格 */}
Through exhaustive desk research and in-depth interviews, we gradually identified key stakeholders and built strong and deep relationships with them. In the process, we gained a deep understanding of their core concerns and values in their respective fields.
