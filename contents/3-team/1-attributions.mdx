## Tang Linzheng

**Student**

**Tasks:**
- Software
- Wiki Coding

We built a system from scratch that utilizes MDX to generate the static wiki’s website, based on the Gatsby.
js framework with Typescript.

 The system programmatically generates the navigation (navbar, footer) and supports KaTex with copy-tex and mhchem extensions.

 It also supports "GitHub Flavored Markdown" syntax, Prismjs for syntax highlighting in code blocks, and mermaid for drawing graphs.

 Additionally, our system includes multiple useful components in MDX writing, such as displaying images and GIFs (Image) with optional captions, using Plotly.
js to create interactive plots (Plot), creating modals that pop up upon button clicks (Modal), embedding PDF files with a native browser reader (PDF), embedding videos (Video) and audio files (Audio) with players, and embedding an interactive 3D model viewer (Model).

 We also support frontmatter options for MDX, including setting the main title at the top of the page (title), specifying the URL path of the page (slug), displaying a favicon in the browser tab (favicon), and a cursor tracer that follows the user’s cursor (tracer).
 
 Moreover, we optimized the website for performance and addressed the limitations of deploying it on GitLab pages.

In our wiki writing support, we developed the iGEM CDN Tool, a command-line tool for uploading, downloading, and deleting files on the iGEM CDN server, with features integrated into the wiki system.
 We supported team members in setting up their software environments for writing the wiki and continuously responded to their demands regarding components and styling.

For the promotion video, I took on the role of an actor.

Additionally, I served as a technical consultant for the DNA Sonify Project and built another website for the project.
